Feedforward neural net for NBA moneyline gambling

Includes two implementations with separate loss functions: odds_loss and profit_loss

odds_loss function predicts only win probability and allows for non-linear optimization of portfolios's Sharpe ratio once predictions have been made.

All data gathered from https://github.com/swar/nba_api
